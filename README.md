# softlocked-jtoh
Update: The development of this version of Softlocked has been put on hold. Please refer to the [the original version of Softlocked](https://www.github.com/uthedev/softlocked) instead.

This is a basic system for running obbies in the [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell) format that I made in my spare time.
It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done with a few extra additions to what came with the Juke's Towers of Hell kit.

The goal of this project is to make an optimized codebase that can be used for JToH fangames and games alike.

## Credits
Thank you to Jukereise and Gammattor for the Juke's Towers of Hell kit.

This project also uses open-sourced code made by other developers. Thank you to those who've worked on and published these lovely contributions to both GitHub and the Roblox marketplace.

At the time of writing, this project uses:
- [JToH Tower Creation Kit v5.4](https://www.roblox.com/library/5732647165/JToH-Tower-Creation-Kit-v5-4)
- [Roact](https://www.github.com/roblox/roact)
- [Signal](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/9f9f8e3f0d50f73392271011aa3a37f137ae03fb/src/signal/src/Shared/Signal.lua)

## Licensing
Various parts of this repository's source code comes directly from the Juke's Towers of Hell Kit.

Due to the unclear licensing of the Juke's Towers of Hell Kit at the time of writing, I'm currently unable to simply apply the MIT License to this repository. This is to avoid legal trouble with Juke's Towers of Hell staff.

If I find the time and motivation to separate the source code from the Juke's Towers of Hell Kit, I'll put this under the MIT License. However, this will require a bit of rewriting, so it may not happen soon.

Even with this in mind though, feel free to study the code!

## Alternatives
If Softlocked isn't the right tower-obby system for you, don't fret! As of writing, fanofpixels, a veteran of the JToH community, has made a sweet and more fully-fledged JToH tower-running system, [fanofpixels' Multi Tower Kit Version 3](https://www.roblox.com/games/6288980926/fanofpixels-Multi-Tower-Kit-V3-Template-Place), that I recommend you check out!
